I am an undergraduate in physics department at Peking(Beijing) University. My research interests broadly include state-of-the-art algorithms for optical, biological, and robotic systems, solving inverse problems as well as physics-informed machine learning. I also care about the impact that different imaging techniques may have on the biotechnology and healthcare sectors. Currently, I work under Dr. Roarke Horstmeyer at the Duke Computational Optics Lab as a visiting student. Before that, Iâ€™ve also dabbled a bit in ODT(Optical Diffraction Tomography) and 
Cryo-EM imaging with Prof. Sun He, where I was introduced to the world of computational imaging.

I am originally from Changsha, a major city in Hunan province, where I engaged in high school-level physics competitions. It was an unforgettable experience, requiring considerable effort and perseverance to win the gold medal, which led to my admission to Peking University, one of China's most prestigious universities. At Peking University, my fascination with the diverse world of physics grew, prompting my interest in applying physics in the industrial field. This interest is why I'm currently in the engineering department, seeking practical insights into real-world techniques beyond theoretical physics.

In my leisure time, I enjoy photography, exploring cuisine delights, and finding beautiful landscapes. I'm also into watching tennis matches and attending concerts.

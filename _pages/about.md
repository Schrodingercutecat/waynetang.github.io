I am an undergraduate in physics department at Peking(Beijing) University. My research interests include physics-informd machine learning and inverse problem as well as algorithms for optical, biological, and robotic systems. I also cares about the impact that different imaging techniques may have on the biotech and healthcare industries. Currently, I work under Dr. Roarke Horstmeyer at the Duke Computational Optics Lab as a visiting student. Before that, I’ve also dabbled a bit in with Prof. Sun He, doing sth, where I was introduced to the world of optical imaging. In particular, I did some research involving OCT with Prof. Michael Choma and multiphoton microscopy with Prof. Michael Levene.

My research interests are broadly in computational imaging, coherent (and incoherent) optical imaging, tomographic reconstruction algorithms, inverse problems, and machine learning. I have particular experience with optical coherence tomography (OCT), camera array-based microscopy, Fourier ptychography, diffraction tomography, and nonlinear microscopy, but I’m always open to exploring and applying computational optimization techniques to other forms of imaging!

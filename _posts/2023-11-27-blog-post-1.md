Background
------
After stitching pictures from Nasher museum, there are little peaks appeared in the whole image, which might be due to the alogorithm.

Abstract
------
I first tried unsharp masking and median filter. The latter appeared more powerful in lowering the lump. In order to reduce computation time, I then try to detected peaks' center and only modify the surrounding pixels, which is similar to adaptive filtering. 

Need to be improved
------
 - I had problem in how to only assigning values to the around-peak pixels because there's no pre-made fuction to do this. I have not tried yet but I'm concerned that implementing this with a basic loop structure might not take full advantage of NumPy's vectorization optimizationsã€‚
 - I simply select circles with the same radius as the 'around-peak rigion' and it stands out awkwardly on the graph. I plan to use the true adaptive filtering to make it look more natural.

Future Investigation
------
 - There are plenty of other algorithms in the article that I can try if median adaptive filtering doesn't work well: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772671123000050?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=82dcb487daa88c9b

 - I need other types of peak in different reconstrction results to test.
